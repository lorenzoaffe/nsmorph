## Introduction

**nsmorph** is an open source class developed in Python and consisting of some methods to manipulate in a simple and intuitive way 
neutrosophic images through neutrosophic morphological operations. The class shows how the basic morphological operators like NS-dilation, NS-erosion, NS-opening and NS-closing work. 
This new approach overcome the traditional image processing thanks to the use of the neutrosphic logic which takes into account the indeterminacy degree of an element 
providing a better understanding of a processed image. 
Furthermore the code is described in detail and many examples and use cases are also provided.
